# CSLAbot (Cbot)
Cbot is a Discord bot developed in [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/), which is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment based on NodeJS. It works as an assistant bot on [CSLA Discord](https://discord.gg/ekmBnmVY6Z). The basic command that links to other subcommands is `/help`.

It is still being extended with other commands and functions, but the following are worth mentioning:
* automatic moderation of image-only channels
* automatic assignment of roles based on a choice of options
* basic assistance commands
* automatic handling of incoming tickets
* fun commands and much more ...
